<ul>
  <li>Weeks 1-2: Generate detailed forecasts of the future collapse of the Galactic Empire and eventual rise of a successor civilization.</li>
  <li>Weeks 3-4: Record the sum of human knowledge into a massive and comprehensive database.</li>
  <li>Week 5: Transport the database to the edge of the galaxy for safekeeping.</li>
  <li>Week 6-7: Direct enigmatic recordings to be viewed tens of thousands of years in the future that will perplex viewers but ensure that the database is preserved.</li>
  <li>Week 8-10: Establish a Second Foundation to watch over the first in secret, ensuring that unforeseen events will still be recoverable.</li>
  <li>Weeks 11-12: Train the Second Foundation in the techniques used to accurately calculate the future, to allow them to continuously update their plan in accordance with events as they play out.</li>

<p><b>How will this work improve the Ruby community? </b></p>

<p>The Foundation will ensure that Ruby continues to exist for tens of thousands of years, which is a large improvement over the Ruby community dying out entirely during the collapse of human civilization across the galaxy. </p>
