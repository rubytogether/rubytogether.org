summary: Ruby Together is now accepting proposals for open source project funding from any Ruby developer.
---

This update doesn't fit exactly into our regular monthly news cycle, but we are excited to announce [project proposals](/projects).

Ruby Together is now accepting proposals for funded work on Ruby open source projects. Projects are expected to take between 20 and 200 hours, over three months. Proposals are now permanently open, and new projects will be selected for funding once per quarter. Selected projects and progress on those projects will be included in our [regular monthly updates](https://rubytogether.org/news/).

You don't need to have prior open source development experience to propose a project, and you can live anywhere in the world. The project selection committee will choose which projects to fund based on our existing budget, and Ruby Together will fund development work on chosen projects for three months.

Applications are open now. [Apply today](/projects)!
