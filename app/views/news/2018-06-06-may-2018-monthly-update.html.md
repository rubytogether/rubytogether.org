Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During May, our work was supported by [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Stitch Fix](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/), and many others.

## ruby together news

In May, Ruby Together was supported by 77 different companies, including Sapphire member [Stripe](https://stripe.com). [Murb](https://murb.nl/) and [StackPath](https://www.stackpath.com/) joined as Onyx members, and developer Gregory Brown (@practicingdev) became a member. 

We were supported by a total of 86 individual members and 68 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible.

In community events news, our developer evangelist [PJ Hagerty](http://twitter.com/aspleenic) spoke at MalmoRB and Ruby Ireland, and visited CopenhagenRB among other Meetups.

Meanwhile, the Ruby Google Summer of Code projects made progress on a new `bundle remove` command, created mockups for adding two-factor authentication to RubyGems.org, and continued to implement gem security advisories.

## bundler news

In May, Bundler saw some bug fixes, a [new `--skip-install` flag](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/commit/9e87a1ca4b0c3002ac2774e4837234cef7e3ce08) for `bundler add`, and a [new guide on writing Bundler plugins](https://bundler.io/v1.16/guides/bundler_plugins.html). (Thank you [@jules2689](https://github.com/jules2689) for producing this guide!)

Bundler gained 9 new commits, contributed by 3 authors. There were 66 additions and 48 deletions across 17 files.

## rubygems.org news

RubyGems.org saw 17 gem updates and performance improvements for the search page. In addition, we [revised the site footer](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/commit/8de0296d1222e9819ca3a70f678baca0484b99b1) to better clarify how Ruby Central, Ruby Together, and Fastly work together on RubyGems.org.

This month, RubyGems.org gained 27 new commits, contributed by 7 authors. There were 218 additions and 215 deletions across 13 files. 

## rubygems news

RubyGems saw several bug fixes, support for reproducible gem builds, a new command alias `i` for `install`, and for a pre-release of version 3. It gained 25 new commits, contributed by 4 authors. There were 132 additions and 80 deletions across 21 files.

## gemstash news

Gemstash had a few minor fixes this month. It gained 9 new commits, contributed by 2 authors. There were 203 additions and 151 deletions across 36 files.

## ruby toolbox news

Hey everyone!

Like April, May turned out pretty busy for me so I had very limited time to spend on the Toolbox, but I did get around to doing some work on the global metrics rankings that I had written about in the previous updates. I'm currently trying to figure out how to display them best in an 
easy-to-understand manner—for example, gem download counts are distributed pretty unevenly, with the top 1% gems by downloads count being the reason for ~87% of all gem downloads—so it's a bit tricky to display a fair and meaningful ranking for "all the other" projects. I expect to have a work-in-progress pull request on this available in the next week or two, so please keep an eye on [Ruby Toolbox’s PRs](https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pulls) if you are interested in giving feedback on this!

As always, your feedback is very welcome, if you have any suggestions or thoughts you'd like to share you can do so via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues) or by getting in touch with me directly.

Thank you also to everyone who contributed pull requests in May: TeamNautilus, diegobarna, oasic, plentz, skatkov, sunito, and tjwallace.

Best,
Christoph
