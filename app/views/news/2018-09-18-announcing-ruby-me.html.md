<% title "Announcing Ruby Me" %>

A paid mentorship program for early-career Ruby developers.

Ruby Together is extremely excited to announce a new program, designed by Coraline Ada Ehmke: [Ruby Me](https://rubyme.org).

The mission of the RubyMe program is to help early-career developers improve their skills and confidence by contributing to Ruby open source projects, by paying them to pair on open source software for 8 hours per month. Through this program we hope to give these developers the skills and experience that they need for continued growth and success in their careers.

Early-career developers (with a firm grasp of Ruby fundamentals) can apply for a spot in the three-month long program. If you’re a recent bootcamp grad, career switcher, or developer employed at the junior level, we’re looking for you.

Once selected, apprentices will be matched with an experienced Ruby developer. Together, they’ll choose an open source project to work on, and a goal to work towards during the three-month program.

Mentors and apprentices will meet and work together up to 8 hours every month, including documenting and sharing the results of their work. Each mentor and apprentice will be paid USD $75 per hour for their work.

We are accepting a limited number of applications for the pilot program that will run October through December of this year, and then open up for a new and larger cohort in January of 2019.

Learn more or apply today to participate as an apprentice or a mentor at [rubyme.org](https://rubyme.org).
