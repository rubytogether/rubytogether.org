  <h3 id="focus-areas">Focus Areas</h3>

  <p>Today, Ruby Together is committed to improving the three most widely-used core Ruby tools:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Bundler</b>, the Ruby dependency manager, used by every Ruby project to manage and install gems</li>
    <li><b>RubyGems</b>, the code that makes it possible to create gems in the first place</li>
    <li><b>RubyGems.org</b>, the website that provides free hosting for public gems</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h3 id="upcoming-projects">Upcoming Projects</h3>

  <p>As time and funding permits, the Ruby Together team will:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Roll out a <%= link_to "new gem index", "http://andre.arko.net/2014/03/28/the-new-rubygems-index-format/" %> that will make installing gems two to ten times faster than today</li>
    <li>Migrate all of RubyGems.org to the <%= link_to "Fastly CDN", "http://fastly.com" %>, providing dramatic speed improvements when downloading gems and gem data</li>
    <li>Build a gem caching server to easily allow data centers and offices to cache local copies of the gems they need, whether public or private</li>
    <li>Improve <%= rubygems_org %>, adding search, statistics, and more gem information to every page</li>
  </ul>

  <p>And there will be more! We start new projects based on community need and Ruby Together's available funding.</p>

    <section class="progress-bar-entry">
      <p class="amount">$0-10k</p>
      <p class="title">Volunteers</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintenance as time permits</li>
        <li>Fixes take days or weeks</li>

  </section>

  <p>
    We have ambitious fundraising goals, and as we hit them we will kick off even bigger projects:

    <ul>
      <li>Create a public Ruby ecosystem analytics dashboard, including Ruby version usage, Bundler version usage, and dramatically expanded statistics for each gem</li>
      <li>Merge Bundler and RubyGems to stop bugs due to mismatched versions forever</li>
      <li>Expand RubyBench.org into a public benchmark for every commit of Bundler, Rails, and Ruby itself</li>
    </ul>

    Those are just examples, and there's a lot more.
  </p>

  <p>When we hit $35k per month, we'll not only have developers maintaining every core tool, we'll have someone working to improve those tools full time as well. When we hit $50k per month, we'll hire a second full-time developer to focus on maintaining and improving Rails and Ruby itself.</p>

  <p>Ruby needs this, and we need your help to get it done.</p>
