The termination of any such civil or criminal action or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create any presumption that the Indemnitee acted in bad faith and/or was dishonest or fraudulent.</p>
  <p id="8.2">8.2 Advancement of Expenses</p>
  <p>The Company may pay expenses incurred in defending an action, suit, or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit, or proceeding, as authorized by the Board in the specific case, upon receipt of: (a) a written affirmation from the Indemnitee of his or her good faith belief that he or she is entitled to indemnification under this Article 8, and (b) an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount, unless it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is entitled to indemnification under this Article 8.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, the Company shall not be liable to indemnify an Indemnitee under this Article 8 for any amounts paid in settlement of any action or claim effected without the prior written consent of the Company. The Company shall not settle any action or claim in any manner which would impose any penalty or limitation on the Indemnitee without the Indemnitee’s prior written consent. Neither the Company nor any Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold their consent to any proposed settlement.</p>
  <p id="8.4">8.4 Limitation on Amendment</p>
  <p>No amendment, modification, or rescission of this Article 8 shall be effective to limit any Indemnitee’s right to indemnification with respect to any alleged cause of action that accrues or other incident or matter that occurs prior to the date on which such modification, amendment, or rescission is adopted.</p>
